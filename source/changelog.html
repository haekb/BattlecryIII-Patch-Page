<h1 id="important-notice">Important Notice</h1>
<p>This was developed from the last official patch. As such no features/changes of the unoffical patches are included. You should apply this patch on top of a fresh GOG or Steam install!</p>
<p>Also due to some rendering changes this may not work on older previously supported systems. This has only been tested with Windows 10.</p>
